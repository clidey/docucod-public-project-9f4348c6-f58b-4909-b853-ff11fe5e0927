# Test Lifecycle and Discovery

GoogleTest automates the discovery, registration, execution, and reporting of C++ tests, empowering developers to focus on writing meaningful test logic without worrying about manual test management. This guide walks you through GoogleTest's lifecycle — from defining a test to how tests are discovered at runtime, managed during execution, and integrated into build environments.

---

## 1. Defining Tests: Writing and Declaring

The foundation of GoogleTest is the concise declaration of test functions which the framework automatically detects and manages.

- **TEST Macro**: Defines a basic test without a fixture. You specify a test suite (a group) name and a test name.

  ```cpp
  TEST(MySuite, MyTest) {
    EXPECT_EQ(1, 1);  // Test logic and assertions
  }
  ```

- **TEST_F Macro**: Defines a test using a test fixture — a class derived from `testing::Test` that allows shared setup and teardown across multiple tests.

  ```cpp
  class MyFixture : public ::testing::Test {
   protected:
    void SetUp() override {
      // Shared setup code
    }
  };

  TEST_F(MyFixture, Test1) {
    // Uses MyFixture set up
  }
  ```

- **TEST_P and INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P Macros**: Support parameterized tests where different inputs are tested against the same test logic, allowing concise coverage of multiple scenarios.

To dynamically register tests not using macros, GoogleTest provides the advanced `RegisterTest` template API.

---

## 2. Test Registration and Automatic Discovery

GoogleTest performs automatic test discovery by registering test definitions as `TestInfo` objects linked to their corresponding `TestSuite`. This registration happens before `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` is called, ensuring all tests are known to the framework.

- Each `TestInfo` retains metadata: suite name, test name, source file, line, and a factory callable to create test instances.
- Registered test suites (`TestSuite`) maintain a collection of tests, manage their lifecycle, and execute suite-level setup/teardown.
- Test registration is hierarchical: suites contain tests; tests belong to the global `UnitTest` singleton instance.

This automatic discovery eliminates the need for manual test lists or configuration.

---

## 3. Test Execution Lifecycle

During execution, each test progresses through a precise lifecycle: 

1. **SetUpTestSuite**: Called once before the first test in a suite, enabling shared resource initialization.
2. **Test Object Construction**: A fresh test object derived from `testing::Test` is created before each individual test.
3. **SetUp()**: Runs setup code specific to the test instance.
4. **TestBody()**: Contains the actual test code, including assertions and logic.
5. **TearDown()**: Performs test-specific cleanup.
6. **Destruction**: The test object is destroyed, ensuring no state leaks between tests.
7. **TearDownTestSuite**: Called after the last test in the suite completes.

GoogleTest manages this lifecycle internally and automatically invokes overridable hooks (`SetUpTestSuite()`, `SetUp()`, `TearDown()`, etc.) as needed.

Tests run only if they are enabled (not disabled or filtered out).

---

## 4. Filtering, Sharding, and Test Ordering

Users can control which tests run using filters and can distribute tests across machines using shards.

- **Filters**: `--gtest_filter` flag lets users specify glob patterns to select or exclude tests by full test names.
- **Sharding**: Environment variables `GTEST_TOTAL_SHARDS` and `GTEST_SHARD_INDEX` partition tests, enabling parallel execution on different machines.
- **Randomization**: `--gtest_shuffle` runs tests in random order; seed can be controlled for reproducibility.

This flexibility supports complex workflows like selective runs, parallel testing, and isolating flaky tests.

---

## 5. Test Results Reporting

Post execution, GoogleTest generates detailed results:

- Each test's outcome is recorded in a `TestResult` object, listing passes, failures, skips, and timing.
- Failures report file names, lines, failure types, and messages.
- Aggregated test suite and program summary are provided.
- XML or JSON reports can be generated for CI integration using the `--gtest_output` flag.
- Test properties can be logged via `Test::RecordProperty`, enriching test metadata.

The framework provides listeners (`TestEventListener`) to receive and customize these reporting events.

---

## 6. Integration with Build Systems

GoogleTest integrates smoothly with common build tools:

- **CMake**: Adds GoogleTest targets, manages dependencies, and enables test discovery via CTest.
- **Bazel**: Offers GoogleTest rules for defining test targets.

Running `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` from your `main()` method launches execution after proper `InitGoogleTest()` initialization.

C++17 compliance and compatible toolchains are required.

---

## Practical Workflow Example

```cpp
// Define a fixture
class FooTest : public ::testing::Test {
protected:
  void SetUp() override { /* setup code */ }
  void TearDown() override { /* cleanup */ }
};

// Define a test using the fixture
TEST_F(FooTest, DoesBar) {
  EXPECT_EQ(2, 1 + 1);
}

// Main
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

- Running this executable discovers and registers `FooTest.DoesBar`.
- Executes the test lifecycle including `SetUpTestSuite()`, `SetUp()`, `TestBody()`, `TearDown()`, and `TearDownTestSuite()`.
- Reports the results to console and optionally XML/JSON.

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Test Not Running**: Verify that the test is not disabled and matches the filter.
- **Fixture Setup Not Called**: Ensure correct `SetUp()` / `TearDown()` override (case-sensitive).
- **Mixing TEST and TEST_F in the Same Suite**: All tests in a suite must use the same fixture class.
- **Ignoring RUN_ALL_TESTS Return Value**: Always return the value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` from `main()` to correctly reflect test success.
- **Shadowing or Multiple Registrations**: Avoid duplicate test names in the same suite.

Use GoogleTest flags like `--gtest_list_tests` to inspect available tests.
