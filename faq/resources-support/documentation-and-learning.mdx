# Official Documentation and Learning Resources

This page serves as your gateway to core GoogleTest documentation, key external guides, and essential reference materials. It also provides curated recommendations to help you efficiently learn best practices and explore advanced features.

## Core Documentation

### 1. GoogleTest Primer

Start here if you are new to GoogleTest. The primer explains fundamental concepts such as writing basic tests, using assertions, creating test fixtures, running your tests, and best practices.

**Key highlights:**
- Simple `TEST` and `TEST_F` macros for defining tests
- Assertions overview and usage patterns
- Writing and using test fixtures for shared setup
- How `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` drives test execution

Find it here: [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md)

### 2. Testing Reference

This reference details the core APIs you'll use daily to write tests, including:
- Test macros like `TEST`, `TEST_F`, and `TEST_P` for value-parameterized tests
- Test registration, filtering, and execution
- Classes for inspecting test and suite information at runtime
- Event listeners to extend test reporting and behavior

A must-read for hands-on test development: [Testing Reference](reference/testing.md)

### 3. Assertions Reference

GoogleTest offers a comprehensive set of assertion macros to verify code behavior:
- Boolean assertions (`EXPECT_TRUE`, `ASSERT_FALSE`)
- Comparison assertions (`EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_NE`, etc.)
- String and floating-point comparisons
- Exception and death test assertions
- Predicate assertions and custom matchers

Each macro includes fatal and non-fatal variants, enabling finely tuned test flow control.

Explore details at: [Assertions Reference](reference/assertions.md)

### 4. Advanced GoogleTest Topics

After mastering the basics, deepen your expertise with: 
- Using advanced assertions to write clearer failure messages
- Writing custom predicate-format assertions
- Managing fixture setup at suite and program scope
- Writing and controlling death and exception tests
- Leveraging event listeners for custom test output or validations

Enhance your testing skills here: [Advanced GoogleTest Topics](advanced.md)

### 5. Mocking and Matcher References

For tests involving mock objects and flexible assertions, consult:
- Mocking Reference: Defines mock classes and methods, expectations, and behaviors
- Matchers Reference: A rich library of matchers to verify function arguments and outcomes
- Actions Reference: For custom and default behaviors in mocks

Explore core mocking capabilities at:
- [Mocking Reference](reference/mocking.md)
- [Matchers Reference](reference/matchers-actions/core-matchers.md)
- [Actions Reference](reference/matchers-actions/actions.md)

### 6. GoogleTest Samples

Practical, well-commented example tests demonstrating:
- Basic test writing
- Test fixtures
- Typed and parameterized tests
- Mock usage and expectations
- Event listener APIs

Review them here for hands-on learning: [Googletest Samples](samples.md)
