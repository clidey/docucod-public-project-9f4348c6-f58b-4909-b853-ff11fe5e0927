# Test Behaviors, Assertions, and Mocking Nuances

This page clarifies critical nuances around test execution order, assertion failure types, and mocking behaviors in GoogleTest and GoogleMock. It helps users understand how fatal and non-fatal failures propagate and influence test outcomes, how parameterized and typed tests behave and report failures, and how mocking expectations operate in actual test runs.

---

## 1. Test Execution Order and Lifecycle Details

### 1.1. How Does GoogleTest Handle Test Execution Order?

- GoogleTest executes tests grouped by *test suites* (formerly called *test cases*).
- All tests within a suite are run sequentially before moving to the next suite.
- Death tests (test suites with names ending in `DeathTest`) are always run before other suites to mitigate threading issues.
- The order of tests within a suite is deterministic but undefined â€” users should not rely on specific ordering.

### 1.2. What Happens During Test Suite Setup and Teardown?

- Per-suite setup (`SetUpTestSuite()`) is called once before the first test of that suite.
- Per-suite teardown (`TearDownTestSuite()`) is called after the last test.
- Tests in the suite each run with their own fresh instance of the fixture.
- Constructor and destructor are called on each test instance.

### 1.3. How Are Global Environments Handled?

- Global environments registered by `AddGlobalTestEnvironment()` are set up once before any tests run.
- Environments tear down in reverse registration order after all tests finish.
- Fatal or non-fatal failures in environment setup/teardown are recorded and reported.

## 2. Assertions and Failure Handling

### 2.1. What Is the Difference Between Fatal and Non-Fatal Failures?

| Failure Type    | Macro Examples          | Behavior                                        | Use Case                            |
|-----------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Fatal Failure   | `ASSERT_*`, `FAIL()`    | Aborts current function immediately            | When continuing is unsafe or meaningless |
| Non-Fatal Failure | `EXPECT_*`, `ADD_FAILURE()` | Reports failure but continues execution         | To detect multiple issues in one test

> **Important:** Fatal failures only abort the *current* function, *not* the entire test. Without special handling, a helper function with an `ASSERT_*` failure returns early, but the calling test continues.

### 2.2. How Can I Check if a Fatal Failure Occurred?

- Use `HasFatalFailure()` inside a test or fixture to detect if a fatal failure happened so you can return early or skip subsequent code.
- Outside `TEST`/`TEST_F`, use `testing::Test::HasFatalFailure()`.

### 2.3. How to Propagate Fatal Failures Across Helper Functions?

- Wrap calls in `ASSERT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE(statement)` or `EXPECT_NO_FATAL_FAILURE(statement)` to verify no fatal failures occurred during `statement`.
- Alternatively, enable exceptions in GoogleTest and add a listener to throw on fatal failures to simulate propagation.

### 2.4. Can Fatal Assertions Be Used in Constructors or Destructors?

- No. Due to C++ language rules, fatal assertions like `ASSERT_*` and `FAIL()` cannot be used inside constructors or destructors.
- Use `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` instead for such logic.

### 2.5. How to Skip Test Execution at Runtime?

- Use `GTEST_SKIP()` to skip the remainder of the current test.
- Can be called inside test bodies or `SetUp()` methods for fixtures or global environments.

### 2.6. How to Generate Explicit Success and Failure?

- `SUCCEED()` generates a success marker but does not affect overall test outcome.
- `FAIL()` generates a fatal failure immediately.
- `ADD_FAILURE()` generates a non-fatal failure.

## 3. Parameterized and Typed Tests Nuances

### 3.1. What Are Parameterized Tests?

- Parameterized tests allow running the same test logic with multiple input parameters.
- Defined using `TEST_P` and instantiated with `INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P`.
- The current parameter is accessible via `GetParam()`.

### 3.2. What Are Typed Tests and Type-Parameterized Tests?

- Typed tests (`TYPED_TEST_SUITE` + `TYPED_TEST`) run the same test code template over multiple predefined types.
- Type-parameterized tests (`TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P` + `TYPED_TEST_P` + `REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_SUITE_P`) allow defining test logic first, and instantiating with type lists later.

### 3.3. How Are Failures Reported in Parameterized/Typed Tests?

- Failure messages include parameter values or type names to help identify failing cases.
- You can specify custom parameter name generators in instantiation to improve readability.

### 3.4. What Happens if Parameterized or Typed Tests Are Not Instantiated?

- GoogleTest will report errors if tests defined with `TEST_P` or `TYPED_TEST_P` are not instantiated with corresponding macros.
- Use `GTEST_ALLOW_UNINSTANTIATED_PARAMETERIZED_TEST` to suppress such errors if intentional.

## 4. Mocking Behaviors in Test Runs

### 4.1. How Does Mocking Interact with Test Execution?

- Mock objects track expectations set with `EXPECT_CALL` and behaviors with `ON_CALL`.
- Upon test execution, mocks verify that expectations are met (correct calls and orders).
- Failures in mock expectations contribute to test failures.

### 4.2. What Are Strict, Nice, and Naggy Mocks?

- **StrictMock**: Reports unexpected calls as failures.
- **NiceMock**: Suppresses warnings about unexpected calls.
- **NaggyMock** (default): Warns about unexpected calls but does not fail the test.

### 4.3. How Are Mock Expectations Verified?

- By default, verification occurs at mock object destruction and at end of test.
- You can manually call `Mock::VerifyAndClearExpectations()`.

### 4.4. Can Mock Expectations Order Calls?

- Use `InSequence` or `After` to specify call order constraints.
- GoogleMock enforces these at runtime.

### 4.5. How To Handle Mock Leaks in Death Tests?

- Death tests fork/exec subprocesses, so mock leaks may not be detected properly.
- Use `Mock::AllowLeak()` to ignore mock leaks inside death tests.

## 5. Scoped Trace Utility and Logging

### 5.1. What Is `SCOPED_TRACE`?

- `SCOPED_TRACE(message)` adds contextual information (file, line, message) to all assertion failures in the scope.
- Useful when assertions are inside helper functions called multiple times.

### 5.2. Can `SCOPED_TRACE` Be Nested or Used in Loops?

- Yes, multiple `SCOPED_TRACE`s accumulate and all are shown in failure messages.
- Can be used in loops to report additional context like iteration numbers.

### 5.3. How Does Logging Interleave with Test Assertions?

- You can interleave `printf` or logging calls with GoogleTest assertions.
- GoogleTest prints test failures alongside logged output.

## 6. Advanced Usage and Best Practices

### 6.1. Checking Current Test Name and Properties

- Use `UnitTest::GetInstance()->current_test_info()` to retrieve the current test's name and metadata.
- Use `testing::Test::RecordProperty(key, value)` to log custom properties for tests, suites, or the entire test run.

### 6.2. Events Listener API

- Implement `TestEventListener` or derive from `EmptyTestEventListener` to handle test events for custom output or integration.
- Append listeners via `UnitTest::GetInstance()->listeners().Append(listener)`.
- Release (and delete) the default result printer to suppress standard output.

### 6.3. Handling Failure in Event Listeners

- Listeners can generate assertions except inside `OnTestPartResult` methods.
- Order listeners so those not generating failures receive events before failure-raising listeners.

### 6.4. Test Fixture Inheritance

- Fixtures can derive from other fixtures.
- Tests sharing a fixture form a test suite. Multiple suites cannot share the same fixture name with different fixture types.

### 6.5. Recommended Naming Conventions

- Avoid underscores in test suite and test names to prevent naming conflicts.
- Name suites containing death tests with the suffix `DeathTest` to ensure proper ordering.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Pitfalls

### 7.1. Fatal Assertions in Non-Void Functions

- `ASSERT_*` macros generate fatal failures by returning from the current function; only valid in void-returning contexts.
- Use `EXPECT_*` if you cannot convert the function to void.

### 7.2. Failing to Instantiate Parameterized Tests

- Ensure that every `TEST_P` or `TYPED_TEST_P` is paired with a corresponding instantiation macro.

### 7.3. Mixing `TEST` and `TEST_F` in the Same Suite

- All tests in a suite must use the same fixture class.
- Mixing macros in the same suite leads to runtime errors.

### 7.4. Constructor/Destructor Failures

- Do *not* use fatal assertions in constructors or destructors.
- Use `SetUp()` and `TearDown()` functions instead.

### 7.5. Ignored Return Value of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()`

- Always return the result of `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` from `main()` to report accurate test results.

### 7.6. Mock Failures in Multi-threaded Tests

- Failures in mock expectations from other threads may not be caught unless using thread-aware utilities.

## 8. Example: Handling a Fatal Failure in a Helper Function

```cpp
void Helper() {
  ASSERT_EQ(1, 2);  // Fatal failure, aborts current function only
}

TEST(MyTestSuite, MyTest) {
  Helper();

  if (HasFatalFailure()) return;  // Abort test if helper failed

  // rest of test body
}
```

## 9. Example: Using Parameterized Tests with Custom Naming

```cpp
class FooTest : public testing::TestWithParam<int> {};

TEST_P(FooTest, ChecksEven) {
  EXPECT_EQ(GetParam() % 2, 0);
}

INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P(
    EvenTests, FooTest,
    testing::Values(2, 4, 6),
    [](const testing::TestParamInfo<FooTest::ParamType>& info) {
      return "Value_" + std::to_string(info.param);
    });
```

- Always pair your `ASSERT_*` macros with void-returning functions.
- Use `HasFatalFailure()` to conditionally abort tests after failures in helper code.
- Name death test suites clearly and isolate death tests from non-death tests.
- Use `SCOPED_TRACE` to add contextual information to failures within helper functions.
- Use `Mock::AllowLeak()` in death tests to prevent false leak detections.
- Avoid mixing `TEST` and `TEST_F` in the same test suite.
- Avoid underscores in test suite and test names.
- Always return `RUN_ALL_TESTS()` result from `main()`.
