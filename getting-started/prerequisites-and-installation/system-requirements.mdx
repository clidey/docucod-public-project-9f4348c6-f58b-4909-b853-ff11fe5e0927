# System Requirements & Supported Platforms

Ensure your development and build environment aligns with the officially supported system requirements for GoogleTest and GoogleMock. This guarantees compatibility, reliable builds, and smooth integration with your C++ testing workflows.

---

## 1. C++ Standard Version

- GoogleTest requires a C++17-compliant compiler environment.
- To enforce C++17 during build, specify the standard in your build system, for example in CMake:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
```

- If specifying at compiler command line is necessary, use appropriate flags such as `-std=c++17` for GCC or Clang.

---

## 2. Supported Operating Systems

GoogleTest officially supports a wide array of common platforms to fit diverse developer needs.

### Officially Supported Platforms Include:

- **Linux** (multiple distributions)
- **Windows** (desktop, MinGW, Windows Mobile with some considerations)
- **Mac OS X** (including Xcode projects)
- **FreeBSD**
- **OpenBSD**
- **NetBSD**
- **Solaris**
- **AIX**
- **HP-UX**
- **QNX**
- **Fuchsia** (not officially supported; use caution)
- **Cygwin**
- **DragonFly BSD**
- **GNU Hurd**
- **Haiku**
- **z/OS**

> Note: Some platforms like Fuchsia are included but not officially supported, potentially leading to compatibility risks.

---

## 3. Supported Compilers

The officially supported compilers are those that provide full C++17 support and are tested regularly by GoogleTest maintainers.

Typical supported compilers include:

- GCC 7 and later
- Clang 5 and later
- MSVC 2017 Update 3 and later
- Other platform-specific compilers meeting C++17 requirements

It is essential to verify your compiler version supports the appropriate C++ standard and features needed by GoogleTest.

---

## 4. Build Systems & Integration Support

GoogleTest integrates primarily with two build systems, with capabilities available for others via community support.

### Bazel

- Fully supported.
- The `BUILD.bazel` files specify platform constraints and build configurations.
- Notable platform settings include explicit support for Windows, QNX, FreeBSD, OpenBSD.

### CMake

- Community-supported.
- Provides a `CMakeLists.txt` enabling flexible GoogleTest builds.
- Allows building GoogleTest standalone or embedded as a subdirectory in existing projects.
- Supports options such as:
  - `BUILD_GMOCK` to include GoogleMock
  - `INSTALL_GTEST` for installation management
  - `GTEST_HAS_ABSL` when integrating Abseil and RE2 libraries
- Requires CMake 3.16 or later for best compatibility.

> See [Installing with CMake](https://cmake.org/) for installation instructions and usage.

### Other Build Environments

- Custom or manual build integration is feasible by including GoogleTest headers and linking provided libraries.

---

## 5. Multi-threading and Exception Support

- GoogleTest is thread-safe on platforms with pthread support.
- Exception handling depends on compiler and build flags.
- You can control thread safety and exception catching via compile flags and macros such as:
  - `GTEST_HAS_PTHREAD` for pthread availability
  - `-DGTEST_HAS_PTHREAD=1` / `0` to override pthread detection
  - `-DGTEST_HAS_EXCEPTIONS=1` / `0` based on exception support

---

## 6. Runtime and Platform Dependencies

- For POSIX-based systems, dependencies include access to standard libraries like pthread, regex, and file system capabilities.
- On Windows, GoogleTest uses system APIs to provide synchronization and file system functions.
- For platforms without native file systems or environment variables (e.g., embedded), functionality may be limited.

---

## 7. Notes on Platform-Specific Differences

- Windows requires specific handling of CRT linkage when linking GoogleTest dynamically versus statically. Use the CMake option `gtest_force_shared_crt` to control this.
- On Linux and macOS, system tools like `make`, `ninja`, or Xcode are used depending on how GoogleTest is built.
- Some platforms lack full support for POSIX regular expressions; GoogleTest switches to simplified regex implementations in those cases.

---

## 8. Practical Tips to Ensure Compatibility

1. **Verify Compiler Version and Flags**

   Ensure your compiler fully supports C++17. Use `--version` commands or IDE settings to confirm.

2. **Use Supported Build Tools**

   Prefer Bazel or CMake as they offer streamlined integration and tested build configurations.

3. **Link Correct Libraries**

   When using Abseil or RE2, ensure they are linked appropriately if building GoogleTest with `GTEST_HAS_ABSL=1`.

4. **Address Platform-Specific Build Flags**

   Adjust compiler and linker flags for your platform as indicated in the `BUILD.bazel` and `CMakeLists.txt` files.

5. **Test the Setup Early**

   Build and run the included GoogleTest sample tests to validate your environment.

## 9. Where to Find Detailed Platform Support Info

For an updated matrix of supported compilers, platforms, and build tools, consult:

- The [Google foundational C++ support policy](https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support)
- The [Foundational C++ Support Matrix](https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md)

## 10. Next Steps

- Review the [Installing with CMake](../prerequisites-and-installation/installation-cmake) or [Installing with Bazel](../prerequisites-and-installation/installation-bazel) guides to set up your build environment.
- Follow the [Project Setup & Integration](../configuration-and-first-test/project-setup) page to add GoogleTest to your project.
- Validate your installation using the [Validating Your Installation](../troubleshooting-and-validation/validate-setup) guide.
