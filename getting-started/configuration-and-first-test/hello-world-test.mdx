# Your First Test: Hello, GoogleTest!

Welcome to your first step in mastering GoogleTest! This guide will walk you through writing and running your initial C++ test case using GoogleTest. Our goal is to get you confident in creating a simple test file, compiling it, running your test, and interpreting the output. By the end, you'll understand how to write basic assertions and run tests efficiently.

---

## 1. Creating Your First Test File

Let's start by crafting a simple C++ test source file that GoogleTest can execute.

### Step 1: Create a new file named `hello_test.cc`

Open your favorite code editor and create the following file in your project directory.

```cpp
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// A basic test case demonstrating GoogleTest assertions.
TEST(HelloTest, BasicAssertions) {
  // Verify that two strings are different.
  EXPECT_STRNE("hello", "world");

  // Verify that the arithmetic result matches expectation.
  EXPECT_EQ(7 * 6, 42);
}
```

### What this does:

- The macro `TEST()` defines a new test named `BasicAssertions` in the `HelloTest` test suite.
- Inside the test, `EXPECT_STRNE` checks that the two strings are not equal.
- `EXPECT_EQ` checks that the expression `7 * 6` equals `42`.

This is a straightforward way to write tests using GoogleTest's assertion macros.

---

## 2. Compiling Your Test

To run your test, compile it into an executable linked against GoogleTest.

If you used CMake to set up GoogleTest dependencies (see the [Installing with CMake](installation-cmake.md) guide), add the following CMake commands to your `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```cmake
# Enable tests in CMake
enable_testing()

# Declare the test executable
add_executable(hello_test hello_test.cc)

# Link GoogleTest
target_link_libraries(hello_test GTest::gtest_main)

# Discover tests automatically
include(GoogleTest)
gtest_discover_tests(hello_test)
```

### Building commands from the command line

Run these commands from your project root:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

This will generate and build your test executable.

---

## 3. Running the Test

Navigate to the build directory and run tests using the CTest tool (which integrates with CMake tests):

```bash
cd build
ctest
```

### Expected output:

```none
Test project /your/path/build
    Start 1: HelloTest.BasicAssertions
1/1 Test #1: HelloTest.BasicAssertions ........   Passed    0.01 sec

100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 1

Total Test time (real) =   0.01 sec
```

This confirms your test ran successfully.

Alternatively, you can run the test binary directly:

```bash
./hello_test
```

You'll see output indicating which tests ran, and whether they passed or failed.

---

## 4. Interpreting the Test Output

When your tests run, GoogleTest provides clear console output including:

- Names of test suites and tests run
- Pass/fail status for each
- Any assertion failure messages with source file location
- A summary of all test results

For example, a failure might look like:

```none
[ RUN      ] HelloTest.BasicAssertions
/path/to/hello_test.cc:8: Failure
Expected: (7 * 6) == 41, actual: 42 vs 41
[  FAILED  ] HelloTest.BasicAssertions (0 ms)

[----------] 1 test from HelloTest (0 ms total)

[==========] 1 test from 1 test suite ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 0 tests.
[  FAILED  ] 1 test, listed below:
[  FAILED  ] HelloTest.BasicAssertions
```

This helps quickly locate the problem in your code.

---

## 5. Common Options for Running Your Tests

GoogleTest supports numerous command-line flags to customize test execution:

| Flag | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `--gtest_filter=TestSuiteName.TestName` | Runs a specific test by name |
| `--gtest_repeat=n` | Repeat tests n times |
| `--gtest_shuffle` | Randomize test order |
| `--gtest_break_on_failure` | Pause execution on first failure (ideal for debugging) |

To see more flags, run your test binary with `--help`.

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Test fails due to missing GoogleTest headers or libs:** Confirm GoogleTest is installed and your build system correctly links it. Consider using the CMake `FetchContent` module for ease.
- **Tests do not run or discover:** Ensure you call `gtest_discover_tests()` if using CMake, or run the test binary directly.
- **Compilation errors:** Verify your compiler supports C++17 as GoogleTest requires it.

---

## Next Steps

Now that you've written and run your first GoogleTest unit test:

- Explore writing more complex tests using fixtures - see [GoogleTest Primer](primer.md).
- Learn about available assertions in [Assertions Reference](reference/assertions.md).
- Try out the [GoogleTest Samples](samples.md) for practical test examples.
- Integrate GoogleMock for mocking capabilities - start with [Getting Started with GoogleMock](getting-started/configuration-and-first-test/first-mock-example).
